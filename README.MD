# Cublets: A Procedural Life Simulation

Welcome to the Cublets project, a pioneering venture into the realm of artificial life simulation. Currently in its infancy, this project is the foundation for an ambitious exploration of life's digital counterpart.

## Project Status: Early Development

At this early juncture, our project is just beginning to take shape. The landscape is sparse, and the inhabitants are few, but the potential is vast. We appreciate your patience and curiosity as we lay the groundwork for a dynamic world of geometric life.

## Vision

Cublets aims to simulate artificial life with an emphasis on the procedural generation of life entities. Each entity, or "Cublet," is defined by its unique DNA, dictating its appearance, behaviors, and interactions within the digital ecosystem.

## Core Features:

- **DNA-Based Generation**: Every Cublet is born from a unique set of genetic instructions, influencing its form and function within the world.
- **Neural Network Brains**: The behavior of each Cublet is controlled by a simple yet powerful neural network, mimicking the decision-making processes found in life.
- **Interactive Ecosystem**: Cublets interact with their environment and each other, creating a dynamic and evolving digital biosphere.

### Current Focus

Our current efforts are concentrated on establishing the basic framework for DNA-based generation and neural network brains. While the visual and interactive elements are minimal at this stage, they lay the foundation for a complex and engaging simulation.

## Description

This project is at a very early stage and there are not many things to look at at the moment. The main goal of this project is to create a simulation of artificial life, focusing on the generation of life entities based on DNA and their control through their own brain represented by a simple neural network.
